  mainText: If the ball seems to be moving only vertically, which of the following
    is not true?
  audio: {fileID: 0}
  explanation: 
  image: {fileID: 0}
  options:
  - text: Gravity is the one and only external accelerator affecting the vertical
      velocity of the ball (ignore any air resistance).
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: No, this statement is true. There is no other accelerator apart from gravity.
  - text: The horizontal motion interferes with the vertical motion of the ball,
      and affects its vertical speed and acceleration.
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 1
    tip: Correct! The ball's horizontal motion has nothing to do with the vertical
      motion. They are in their own inpendent axes!
  - text: We can apply equations of 1-D motion on only the vertical motion of the
      ball (that is, on the vertical speed and vertical acceleration).
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: No, this statement is true. The 3 equations of motion can be applied of
      the vertical motion of the ball.
  - text: None of these
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: No !
