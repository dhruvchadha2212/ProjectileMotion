  mainText: Here's the final question. Which of the following approaches will easily
    give you the range covered by the ball (up until the first bounce) ?
  audio: {fileID: 0}
  explanation: 
  image: {fileID: 0}
  options:
  - text: Applying $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ in X direction
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: No, think simple. Horizontal motion of the ball doesn't involve any acceleration.
  - text: Applying $v = u + at$ in Y direction
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: No, we need range of the ball. Above equation only deals with time, velocity
      and acceleration.
  - text: Applying $Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}$ in X direction.
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 1
    tip: Perfect ! Since the motion in horizontal direction is not accelerated, we
      can use this simple equation.
  - text: Applying $s=ut+\frac{1}{2} a t^2$ in X direction
    image: {fileID: 0}
    isCorrect: 0
    tip: Theoretically you can. But since the horizontal motion is not accelerated,
      there is a simpler approach.
